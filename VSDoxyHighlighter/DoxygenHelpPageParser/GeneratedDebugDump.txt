Command: addtogroup
Parameters: <name> [(title)]
Help text:
Defines a group just like \defgroup, but in contrast to that command using the same <name> more than once will not result in a warning, but rather one group with a merged documentation and the first title found in any of the commands.

The title is optional, so this command can also be used to add a number of entities to an existing group using @{ and @} like this:

     /*! \addtogroup mygrp
      *  Additional documentation for group 'mygrp'
      *  @{
      */
   
     /*!
      *  A function
      */
     void func1()
     {
     }
   
     /*! Another function */
     void func2()
     {
     }
   
     /*! @} */

Command: callgraph
Parameters: 
Help text:
When this command is put in a comment block of a function or method and HAVE_DOT is set to YES, then doxygen will generate a call graph for that function (provided the implementation of the function or method calls other documented functions). The call graph will be generated regardless of the value of CALL_GRAPH.

Note: The completeness (and correctness) of the call graph depends on the doxygen code parser which is not perfect.

Command: qualifier
Parameters: <label> | "(text)"
Help text:
With this command it is possible to add custom qualifier labels to members and classes. These labels will be shown in the output in the same way as the automatically generated labels such as "static", "inline", and "final".

====================================
Command: category
Parameters: <name> [<header-file>] [<header-name>]
Help text:
For Objective-C only: Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a class category with name <name>. The arguments are equal to the \class command.

See also: command \class.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: class
Parameters: <name> [<header-file>] [<header-name>]
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a class with name <name>. Optionally a header file and a header name can be specified. If the header-file is specified, a link to a verbatim copy of the header will be included in the HTML documentation. The <header-name> argument can be used to overwrite the name of the link that is used in the class documentation to something other than <header-file>. This can be useful if the include name is not located on the default include path (like <X11/X.h>). With the <header-name> argument you can also specify how the include statement should look like, by adding either quotes or sharp brackets around the name. Sharp brackets are used if just the name is given. Note that the last two arguments can also be specified using the \headerfile command.

Example: 
   /* A dummy class */
    
   class Test
   {
   };
    
   /*! \class Test class.h "inc/class.h"
    *  \brief This is a test class.

====================================
Command: defgroup
Parameters: <name> (group title)
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a group of classes, files or namespaces. This can be used to categorize classes, files or namespaces, and document those categories. You can also use groups as members of other groups, thus building a hierarchy of groups.

The <name> argument should be a single-word identifier.

See also: page Grouping, commands \ingroup, \addtogroup, and \weakgroup.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: dir
Parameters: [<path fragment>]
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a directory. The "path fragment" argument should include the directory name and enough of the path to be unique with respect to the other directories in the project. The STRIP_FROM_PATH option determines what is stripped from the full path before it appears in the output.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: enum
Parameters: <name>
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for an enumeration, with name <name>. If the enum is a member of a class and the documentation block is located outside the class definition, the scope of the class should be specified as well. If a comment block is located directly in front of an enum declaration, the \enum comment may be omitted.

Note: The type of an anonymous enum cannot be documented, but the values of an anonymous enum can.

Example: 
   class Enum_Test
   {
    public:
    enum TEnum { Val1, Val2 };
    
       /*! Another enum, with inline docs */
    enum AnotherEnum 
       { 
         V1, /*!< value 1 */
         V2  /*!< value 2 */
       };
   };
    
   /*! \class Enum_Test
    * The class description.
    */
    
   /*! \enum Enum_Test::TEnum
    * A description of the enum type.
    */
    
   /*! \var Enum_Test::TEnum Enum_Test::Val1
    * The description of the first enum value.
    */
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: example
Parameters: ['{lineno}'] <file-name>
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a source code example. The name of the source file is <file-name>. The contents of this file will be included in the documentation, just after the documentation contained in the comment block. You can add option {lineno} to enable line numbers for the example if desired. All examples are placed in a list. The source code is scanned for documented members and classes. If any are found, the names are cross-referenced with the documentation. Source files or directories can be specified using the EXAMPLE_PATH tag of doxygen's configuration file.

If <file-name> itself is not unique for the set of example files specified by the EXAMPLE_PATH tag, you can include part of the absolute path to disambiguate it.

If more than one source file is needed for the example, the \include command can be used.

Example: 
   /** A Example_Test class.
    *  More details about this class.
    */
    
   class Example_Test
   {
    public:
       /** An example member function.
        *  More details about this function.
        */
    void example();
   };
    
   void Example_Test::example() {}
    
   /** \example example_test.cpp
    * This is an example of how to use the Example_Test class.
    * More details about this example.
    */

 Where the example file example_test.cpp looks as follows: 
   void main()
   {
     Example_Test t;
     t.example();
   }

The file manual.c in the example directory shows how to use this command.


See also: command \implements and command \memberof
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: file
Parameters: [<name>]
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a source or header file with name <name>. The file name may include (part of) the path if the file-name alone is not unique. If the file name is omitted (i.e. the line after \file is left blank) then the documentation block that contains the \file command will belong to the file it is located in.

Important: The documentation of 
global functions, variables, typedefs, and enums will only be included 
in the output if the file they are in is documented as well or if EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES.

Example: 
   /** \file file.h
    * A brief file description.
    * A more elaborated file description.
    */
    
   /**
    * A global integer value.
    * More details about this value.
    */
   extern int globalValue;

Note: In the above example JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF has been set to YES in the configuration file.

====================================
Command: fileinfo
Parameters: ['{'option'}']
Help text:
Shows (part) of the file name in which this command is placed. The option can be name, extension, filename, directory or, full, with
  • name the name of the file without extension
  • extension the extension of the file
  • filename the filename i.e. name plus extension
  • directory the directory of the given file
  • full the full path and filename of the given file.

In case no option is specified the filename is used unless FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES in which case full is used.

Note: the command \fileinfo cannot be used as argument to the \file command

====================================
Command: fn
Parameters: (function declaration)
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a function (either global or as a member of a class). This command is **only** needed if a comment block is **not** placed in front (or behind) the function declaration or definition.

If your comment block **is** in front of the function declaration or definition this command can (and to avoid redundancy should) be omitted.

A full function declaration including arguments should be specified after the \fn command on a **single** line, since the argument ends at the end of the line!

This command is equivalent to \var, \typedef, and \property.

Warning: Do not use this command if it is not absolutely needed, since it will lead to duplication of information and thus to errors.

Example: 
   class Fn_Test
   {
    public:
    const char *member(char,int) throw(std::out_of_range);
   };
    
   const char *Fn_Test::member(char c,int n) throw(std::out_of_range) {}
    
   /*! \class Fn_Test
    * \brief Fn_Test class.
    *
    * Details about Fn_Test.
    */
    
   /*! \fn const char *Fn_Test::member(char c,int n) 
    *  \brief A member function.
    *  \param c a character.
    *  \param n an integer.
    *  \exception std::out_of_range parameter is out of range.
    *  \return a character pointer.
    */

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: headerfile
Parameters: <header-file> [<header-name>]
Help text:
Intended to be used for class, struct, or union documentation, where the documentation is in front of the definition. The arguments of this command are the same as the second and third argument of \class. The <header-file> name refers to the file that should be included by the application to obtain the definition of the class, struct, or union. The <header-name> argument can be used to overwrite the name of the link that is used in the class documentation to something other than <header-file>. This can be useful if the include name is not located on the default include path (like <X11/X.h>).

With the <header-name> argument you can also specify how the include statement should look like, by adding either double quotes or sharp brackets around the name. By default sharp brackets are used if just the name is given.

If a pair of double quotes is given for either the <header-file> or <header-name> argument, the current file (in which the command was found) will be used but with quotes. So for a comment block with a \headerfile command inside a file test.h, the following three commands are equivalent:

     \headerfile test.h "test.h"
     \headerfile test.h ""
     \headerfile "" 

To get sharp brackets you do not need to specify anything, but if you want to be explicit you could use any of the following:

     \headerfile test.h <test.h>
     \headerfile test.h <>
     \headerfile <> 

To globally reverse the default include representation to local includes you can set FORCE_LOCAL_INCLUDES to YES.

To disable the include information altogether set SHOW_HEADERFILE to NO.

Command: hideinitializer
Parameters: 
Help text:
By default the value of a define and the initializer of a variable are displayed unless they are longer than 30 lines. By putting this command in a comment block of a define or variable, the initializer is always hidden. The maximum number of initialization lines can be changed by means of the configuration parameter MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES, the default value is 30.

====================================
Command: ingroup
Parameters: (<groupname> [<groupname>]*)
Help text:
If the \ingroup command is placed in a comment block of a compound entity (like class, file or namespace), then it will be added to the group(s) identified by the <groupname>(s). In case of members (like variable, functions, typedefs and enums) the member will be added only to one group (to avoid ambiguous linking targets in case a member is not documented in the context of its class, namespace or file, but only visible as part of a group).

====================================
Command: interface
Parameters: <name> [<header-file>] [<header-name>]

See also: command \class.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: internal
Parameters: 
Help text:
This command starts a documentation fragment that is meant for internal use only. The fragment naturally ends at the end of the comment block. You can also force the internal section to end earlier by using the \endinternal command.

If the \internal command is put inside a section (see for example \section) all subsections after the command are considered to be internal as well. Only a new section at the same level will end the fragment that is considered internal.

You can use INTERNAL_DOCS in the configuration file to show (YES) or hide (NO) the internal documentation.

See also: command \endinternal.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: mainpage
Parameters: [(title)]
Help text:
If the \mainpage command is placed in a comment block the block is used to customize the index page (in HTML) or the first chapter (in LaTeX).

The title argument is optional and replaces the default title that doxygen normally generates. If you do not want any title you can specify notitle as the argument of \mainpage.

Here is an example:

   /*! \mainpage My Personal Index Page
    *
    * \section intro_sec Introduction
    *
    * This is the introduction.
    *
    * \section install_sec Installation
    *
    * \subsection step1 Step 1: Opening the box

Command: memberof
Parameters: <name>
Help text:
This command makes a function a member of a class in a similar way as \relates does, only with this command the function is represented as a real member of the class. This can be useful when the programming language does not support the concept of member functions natively (e.g. C).

It is also possible to use this command together with \public, \protected or \private.

The file manual.c in the example directory shows how to use this command.

Command: nosubgrouping
Parameters: 
Help text:

See also: commands \publicsection, \protectedsection and \privatesection.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: overload
Parameters: [(function declaration)]
Help text:
This command can be used to generate the following standard text for an overloaded member function:

   ‍This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It 
   differs from the above function only in what argument(s) it accepts. 


If the documentation for the overloaded member function is not located in front of the function declaration or definition, the optional argument should be used to specify the correct function.

Any other documentation that is inside the documentation block will by appended after the generated message.

Note 1: You are responsible that 
there is indeed an earlier documented member that is overloaded by this 
one. To prevent that document reorders the documentation you should set SORT_MEMBER_DOCS to NO in this case. 

Note 2: The \overload command does not work inside a one-line comment. 

Example: 
   class Overload_Test 
   {
    public:
    void drawRect(int,int,int,int);
    void drawRect(const Rect &r);
   };
    
   void Overload_Test::drawRect(int x,int y,int w,int h) {}
   void Overload_Test::drawRect(const Rect &r) {}
    
   /*! \class Overload_Test

Command: package
Parameters: <name>
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a Java package with name <name>.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: page
Parameters: <name> (title)
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains a piece of documentation that is not directly related to one specific class, file or member. The HTML generator creates a page containing the documentation. The LaTeX generator starts a new section in the chapter 'Page documentation'.

Example: 
   /*! \page page1 A documentation page
     \tableofcontents
     Leading text.
     \section sec An example section
     This page contains the subsections \ref subsection1 and \ref subsection2.
     For more info see page \ref page2.
     \subsection subsection1 The first subsection
     Text.
     \subsection subsection2 The second subsection
     More text.
   */
    
   /*! \page page2 Another page
     Even more info.
   */

Note: The <name> argument consists of a combination of letters and number digits. If you wish to use upper case letters (e.g. MYPAGE1), or mixed case letters (e.g. MyPage1) in the <name> argument, you should set CASE_SENSE_NAMES to YES.
 However, this is advisable only if your file system is case sensitive. 
Otherwise (and for better portability) you should use all lower case 
letters (e.g. mypage1) for <name> in all references to the page.

====================================
Command: private
Parameters: 
Help text:
Indicates that the member documented by the comment block is private, i.e., should only be accessed by other members in the same class.

Note that doxygen automatically detects the protection level of members in object-oriented languages. This command is intended for use only when the language does not support the concept of protection level natively (e.g. C, PHP 4).

For starting a section of private members, in a way similar to the "private:" class marker in C++, use \privatesection.

Parameters: 
Help text:
Indicates that the member documented by the comment block is pure virtual, i.e., it is abstract and has no implementation associated with it.

This command is intended for use only when the language does not support the concept of pure virtual methods natively (e.g. C, PHP 4).

====================================
Command: relates
Parameters: <name>
Help text:
This command can be used in the documentation of a non-member function <name>. It puts the function inside the 'related function' section of the class documentation. This command is useful for documenting non-friend functions that are nevertheless strongly coupled to a certain class. It prevents the need of having to document a file, but only works for functions.

Example: 
   /*! 
    * A String class.
    */ 
    
   class String
   {
    friend int strcmp(const String &,const String &);
   };
    
   /*! 
    * Compares two strings.
    */
    
   int strcmp(const String &s1,const String &s2)
   {
   }
    
   /*! \relates String
    * A string debug function.
    */
   void stringDebug()
   {
   }

====================================
Command: relatesalso
Parameters: <name>
Help text:
This command can be used in the documentation of a non-member function <name>. It puts the function both inside the 'related function' section of the class documentation as well as leaving it at its normal file documentation location. This command is useful for documenting non-friend functions that are nevertheless strongly coupled to a certain class. It only works for functions.

====================================
Command: showinitializer
Parameters: 
Help text:
By default the value of a define and the initializer of a variable are only displayed if they are less than 30 lines long. By putting this command in a comment block of a define or variable, the initializer is shown unconditionally. The maximum number of initialization lines can be changed by means of the configuration parameter MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES, the default value is 30.

See also: command \hideinitializer.

====================================
Command: static
Parameters: 
Help text:
Indicates that the member documented by the comment block is static, i.e., it works on a class, instead of on an instance of the class.

This command is intended for use only when the language does not support the concept of static methods natively (e.g. C).
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: struct
Parameters: <name> [<header-file>] [<header-name>]
Help text:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: var
Parameters: (variable declaration)
Help text:
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a variable or enum value (either global or as a member of a class). This command is equivalent to \fn, \property, and \typedef.

Note that for PHP one can also specify the type of the variable. The syntax is similar as for the phpDocumentor but the description has to start at the next line, i.e.

   @var  datatype $varname
   Description

See also: command \fn, \property, and \typedef.

Command: author
Parameters: { list of authors }
Help text:
Starts a paragraph where one or more author names may be entered. The paragraph will be indented. The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. Multiple adjacent \author commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each author description will start a new line. Alternatively, one \author command may mention several authors. The \author command ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered.

Example: 
   /*!

====================================
Command: brief
Parameters: { brief description }
Help text:
Starts a paragraph that serves as a brief description. For classes and files the brief description will be used in lists and at the start of the documentation page. For class and file members, the brief description will be placed at the declaration of the member and prepended to the detailed description. A brief description may span several lines (although it is advised to keep it brief!). A brief description ends when a blank line or another sectioning command is encountered. If multiple \brief commands are present they will be joined. See section \author for an example.

Synonymous to \short.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: bug
Parameters: { bug description }
Help text:
Starts a paragraph where one or more bugs may be reported. The paragraph will be indented. The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. Multiple adjacent \bug commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each bug description will start on a new line. Alternatively, one \bug command may mention several bugs. The \bug command ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered. See section \author for an example.

The description will also add an item to a separate Bug list and the two instances of the description will be cross-referenced. Each item in the Bug list will be preceded by a header that indicates the origin of the item.

The Bug list and the corresponding entries can be disabled by setting the GENERATE_BUGLIST to NO.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: cond
Parameters: [(section-label)]
Help text:
Starts a conditional section that ends with a corresponding \endcond command, which is typically found in another comment block. The main purpose of this pair of commands is to (conditionally) exclude part of a file from processing (in older version of doxygen this could only be achieved using C preprocessor commands).

The section between \cond and \endcond can be included by adding its section label to the ENABLED_SECTIONS configuration option. If the section label is omitted, the section will be excluded from processing unconditionally. The section label can be a logical expression build of section labels, round brackets, && (AND), || (OR) and ! (NOT). If you use an expression you need to wrap it in round brackets, i.e \cond (!LABEL1 && LABEL2).

For conditional sections within a comment block one should use a \if ... \endif block. When using \cond and the condition is not satisfied the current comment block is ended and everything until the matching \endcond is removed and a new command block is started there.

Conditional sections can be nested. In this case a nested section will only be shown if it and its containing section are included.

Here is an example showing the commands in action:

   /** An interface */
   class Intf
   {
     public:
       /** A method */
       virtual void func() = 0;
   
       /// @cond TEST
   
       /** A method used for testing */
       virtual void test() = 0;
   
       /// @endcond
   };
   
   /// @cond DEV
   /*
    *  The implementation of the interface
    */
   class Implementation : public Intf
   {
     public:
       void func();
   
       /// @cond TEST
       void test();
       /// @endcond
   
       /// @cond
       /** This method is obsolete and does
        *  not show up in the documentation.
        */
       void obsolete();
       /// @endcond
   };
   
   /// @endcond

The output will be different depending on whether or not ENABLED_SECTIONS contains TEST, or DEV

See also: commands \if, \ifnot, \else, \elseif, \endif, \endcond, and ENABLED_SECTIONS.

Note: Due to the moment of parsing the \cond and \endcond commands cannot be used in ALIASES.

    %%    A % character.                                           

Note that the <format> has to be between double quotes.

In case the <date_time> is specified it has to have the following representation:
  • optional date where date is:
    •• 4 digits for the year
    •• a minus sign
    •• one or 2 digits for the month
    •• a minus sign
    •• one or 2 digits for the day
  • optional time where time is:
    •• whitespace
    •• one or 2 digits for the hours
    •• a colon sign
    •• one or 2 digits for the minutes
    •• when the format contains %S or %-S
      ••• a colon sign
      ••• 2 digits for the seconds

in case the <date_time> is not specified the current date and time are used.

Here is an example:

   - \showdate "%A %d-%m-%Y" 2015-3-14
   - \showdate "%a %d-%m-%y" 2015-3-14
   - \showdate "%-m.%d%y" 2015-3-14

====================================
Command: details
Parameters: { detailed description }
Help text:
Just like \brief starts a brief description, \details starts the detailed description. You can also start a new paragraph (blank line) then the \details command is not needed.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: noop
Parameters: ( text to be ignored )
Help text:
All the text, including the command, till the end of the line is ignored. The command will most commonly be used in combination with ALIASES to ignore not supported commands that are present for e.g. other processing tools.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: raisewarning
Parameters: ( text to be shown as warning )
Help text:
All the text, excluding the command, till the end of the line is literally shown as a documentation warning. The text, including the command, is removed from the output. The command will most commonly be used in combination with ALIASES to show a specific warning.
Example: 
   \raisewarning My specific warnning
   
   \warnNoDoc
   
   \warnNoDoc{My specific warnning}

 together with: 
   ALIASES  = warnNoDoc="\raisewarning Missing documentation"
   ALIASES += warnNoDoc{1}="\raisewarning Incomplete documentation: \1"

 will result in: 
      ex_1.md:1: warning: My specific warnning

Command: else
Parameters: 
Help text:
Starts a conditional section if the previous conditional section was not enabled. The previous section should have been started with a \if, \ifnot, or \elseif command.

See also: commands \if, \ifnot, \elseif, \endif.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: elseif
Parameters: (section-label)
Help text:
Starts a conditional documentation section if the previous section was not enabled. A conditional section is disabled by default. To enable it you must put the section-label after the ENABLED_SECTIONS tag in the configuration file. The section label can be a logical expression build of section names, round brackets, && (AND), || (OR) and ! (NOT). Conditional blocks can be nested. A nested section is only enabled if all enclosing sections are enabled as well.

See also: commands \if, \ifnot, \else, \endif.

====================================
Command: endcond
Parameters: 
Help text:
Ends a conditional section that was started by \cond.

See also: command \cond.

Note: Due to the moment of parsing the \endcond and \cond commands cannot be used in ALIASES.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: endif
Parameters: 
Help text:
Ends a conditional section that was started by \if or \ifnot For each \if or \ifnot one and only one matching \endif must follow.

See also: commands \if, \ifnot, \else, \elseif.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: exception
Parameters: <exception-object> { exception description }
Help text:
Starts an exception description for an exception object with name <exception-object>. Followed by a description of the exception. The existence of the exception object is not checked. The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. Multiple adjacent \exception commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each exception description will start on a new line. The \exception description ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered. See section \fn for an example.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: if
Parameters: (section-label)
Help text:
Starts a conditional documentation section. The section ends with a matching \endif command. A conditional section is disabled by default. To enable it you must put the section-label after the ENABLED_SECTIONS tag in the configuration file.

The section label can be a logical expression build of section names, round brackets, && (AND), || (OR) and ! (NOT). If you use an expression you need to wrap it in round brackets, i.e \if (!LABEL1 && LABEL2).

Conditional blocks can be nested. A nested section is only enabled if all enclosing sections are enabled as well.

The \if and corresponding \endif have to be in the same comment block. When a conditional block needs to span more than one comment block one has to use \cond ... \endcond.

Example: 
     /*! Unconditionally shown documentation.
      *  \if Cond1
      *    Only included if Cond1 is set.
      *  \endif
      *  \if Cond2
      *    Only included if Cond2 is set.
      *    \if Cond3
      *      Only included if Cond2 and Cond3 are set.
      *    \endif
      *    More text.
      *  \endif
      *  Unconditional text.
      */



You can also use conditional commands inside aliases. To document a class in two languages you could for instance use:

Example 2: 
   /*! \english
    *  This is English.
    *  \endenglish
    *  \dutch
    *  Dit is Nederlands.
    *  \enddutch
    */
   class Example
   {
   };



Where the following aliases are defined in the configuration file:

   ALIASES  = "english=\if english" \
              "endenglish=\endif" \
              "dutch=\if dutch" \
              "enddutch=\endif"

and ENABLED_SECTIONS can be used to enable either english or dutch.

See also: commands \endif, \ifnot, \else, \elseif, \cond, \endcond, and ENABLED_SECTIONS.

====================================
Command: ifnot
Parameters: (section-label)
Help text:
Starts a conditional documentation section. The section ends with a matching \endif command. This conditional section is enabled by default. To disable it you must put the section-label after the ENABLED_SECTIONS tag in the configuration file. The section label can be a logical expression build of section names, round brackets, && (AND), || (OR) and ! (NOT).

====================================
Command: invariant
Parameters: { description of invariant }
Help text:
Starts a paragraph where the invariant of an entity can be described. The paragraph will be indented. The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. Multiple adjacent \invariant commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each invariant description will start on a new line. Alternatively, one \invariant command may mention several invariants. The \invariant command ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: note
Parameters: { text }
Help text:
Starts a paragraph where a note can be entered. The paragraph will be indented. The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. Multiple adjacent \note commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each note description will start on a new line. Alternatively, one \note command may mention several notes. The \note command ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered. See section \par for an example.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: par
Parameters: [(paragraph title)] { paragraph }
Help text:
If a paragraph title is given this command starts a paragraph with a user defined heading. The heading extends until the end of the line. The paragraph following the command will be indented.

If no paragraph title is given this command will start a new paragraph. This will also work inside other paragraph commands (like \param or \warning) without ending that command.

The text of the paragraph has no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph. The \par command ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered.

Example: 
   /*! \class Par_Test
    * Normal text.
    *
    * \par User defined paragraph:
    * Contents of the paragraph.
    *
    * \par
    * New paragraph under the same heading.
    *
    * \note
    * This note consists of two paragraphs.
    * This is the first paragraph.
    *
    * \par
    * And this is the second paragraph.
    *
    * More normal text. 
    */
    
   class Par_Test {};

====================================
Command: param
Parameters: '['dir']' <parameter-name> { parameter description }
Help text:
Starts a parameter description for a function parameter with name <parameter-name>, followed by a description of the parameter. The existence of the parameter is checked and a warning is given if the documentation of this (or any other) parameter is missing or not present in the function declaration or definition.

The \param command has an optional attribute, dir, specifying the direction of the parameter. Possible values are "[in]", "[in,out]", and "[out]", note the [square] brackets in this description. When a parameter is both input and output, [in,out] is used as attribute. Here is an example for the function memcpy:

   /*!
    * Copies bytes from a source memory area to a destination memory area,
    * where both areas may not overlap.
    * @param[out] dest The memory area to copy to.
    * @param[in]  src  The memory area to copy from.
    * @param[in]  n    The number of bytes to copy
    */
   void memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

The parameter description is a paragraph with no special internal structure. All visual enhancement commands may be used inside the paragraph.

Multiple adjacent \param commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each parameter description will start on a new line. The \param description ends when a blank line or some other sectioning command is encountered. See section \fn for an example.

Note that you can also document multiple parameters with a single \param command using a comma separated list. Here is an example:

   /** Sets the position.
    *  @param x,y,z Coordinates of the position in 3D space.
    */
   void setPosition(double x,double y,double z,double t)
   {
   }

Note that for PHP one can also specify the type (or types if you separate them with a pipe symbol) which are allowed for a parameter (as this is not part of the definition). The syntax is the same as for the phpDocumentor, i.e.

   @param  datatype1|datatype2 $paramname description
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: parblock
Parameters: 
Help text:
For commands that expect a single paragraph as argument (such as \par, \param and \warning), the \parblock command allows to start a description that covers multiple paragraphs, which then ends with \endparblock.

Example:

   /** Example of a param command with a description consisting of two paragraphs
    *  \param p
    *  \parblock
    *  First paragraph of the param description.
    *
    *  Second paragraph of the param description.
    *  \endparblock
    *  Rest of the comment block continues.
    */

Note that the \parblock command may also appear directly after \param's first argument.

Command: xrefitem
Parameters: <key> "heading" "list title" { text }
Help text:
This command is a generalization of commands such as \todo and \bug. It can be used to create user-defined text sections which are automatically cross-referenced between the place of occurrence and a related page, which will be generated. On the related page all sections of the same type will be collected.

The first argument <key> is an identifier uniquely representing the type of the section. The second argument is a quoted string representing the heading of the section under which text passed as the fourth argument is put. The third argument (list title) is used as the title for the related page containing all items with the same key. The second and third string argument cannot contain a newline. The keys "todo", "test", "bug" and "deprecated" are predefined.

To get an idea on how to use the \xrefitem command and what its effect is, consider the todo list, which (for English output) can be seen an alias for the command

   \xrefitem todo "Todo" "Todo List" 

Since it is very tedious and error-prone to repeat the first three parameters of the command for each section, the command is meant to be used in combination with the ALIASES option in the configuration file. To define a new command \reminder, for instance, one should add the following line to the configuration file:

   ALIASES += "reminder=\xrefitem reminders \"Reminder\" \"Reminders\"" 

Note the use of escaped quotes for the second and third argument of the \xrefitem command.

In case parameter "(heading)" is the empty string no heading is generated. This can be useful when used in combination with the \page command e.g.

   /** @page my_errors My Errors
    *  @brief Errors page
    *
    *  Errors page contents.
    */
   
   /** \error ERROR 101: in case a file can not be opened.
       Check about file system read/write access. */
   #define MY_ERR_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE                   101
   
   /** \error ERROR 102: in case a file can not be closed.
       Check about file system read/write access. */
   #define MY_ERR_CANNOT_CLOSE_FILE                  102

with \error defined as

   ALIASES += "error=\xrefitem my_errors \"\" \"\""

Command: subpage
Parameters: <name> ["(text)"]
Help text:
This command can be used to create a hierarchy of pages. The same structure can be made using the \defgroup and \ingroup commands, but for pages the \subpage command is often more convenient. The main page (see \mainpage) is typically the root of hierarchy.

This command behaves similar as \ref in the sense that it creates a reference to a page labeled <name> with the optional link text as specified in the second argument.

It differs from the \ref command in that it only works for pages, and creates a parent-child relation between pages, where the child page (or sub page) is identified by label <name>.

See the \section and \subsection commands if you want to add structure without creating multiple pages.

Note: Each page can be the sub page 
of only one other page and no cyclic relations are allowed, i.e. the 
page hierarchy must have a tree structure.

Here is an example:

   /*! \mainpage A simple manual
   
   Some general info.
   
   This manual is divided in the following sections:
   - \subpage intro
   - \subpage advanced "Advanced usage"
   */
   
   //-----------------------------------------------------------
   
   /*! \page intro Introduction
   This page introduces the user to the topic.
   Now you can proceed to the \ref advanced "advanced section".
   */
   
   //-----------------------------------------------------------
   
   /*! \page advanced Advanced Usage
   This page is for advanced users.
   Make sure you have first read \ref intro "the introduction".

Command: tableofcontents
Parameters: ['{'[option[:level]][,option[:level]]*'}']
Help text:
Creates a table of contents at the top of a page, listing all sections and subsections in the page. The option can be HTML or LaTeX or XML or DocBook. When a level is specified this means the maximum nesting level that is shown. The value of level should be in the range 1..5, values outside this range are considered to be 5. In case no level is specified level is set to 5 (show all) In case no option. is specified \tableofcontents acts as if just the option HTML and XML was specified. In case of multiple \tableofcontents commands in a page the option(s) will be used additional to the already specified option(s), but only the last level of an option is valid.

====================================
Command: dontinclude
Parameters: ['{lineno}'] <file-name>
Help text:
This command can be used to parse a source file without actually verbatim including it in the documentation (as the \include command does). This is useful if you want to divide the source file into smaller pieces and add documentation between the pieces. Source files or directories can be specified using the EXAMPLE_PATH tag of doxygen's configuration file.

You can add option {lineno} to enable line numbers for the included code if desired.

The class and member declarations and definitions inside the code fragment are 'remembered' during the parsing of the comment block that contained the \dontinclude command.

For line by line descriptions of source files, one or more lines of the example can be displayed using the \line, \skip, \skipline, and \until commands. An internal pointer is used for these commands. The \dontinclude command sets the pointer to the first line of the example.

Example: 
    
   /*! A test class. */
    
   class Include_Test
   {
    public:
       /// a member function
    void example();
   };
    
   /*! \page pag_example
    *  \dontinclude include_test.cpp
    *  Our main function starts like this:
    *  \skip main
    *  \until {
    *  First we create an object \c t of the Include_Test class.
    *  \skipline Include_Test
    *  Then we call the example member function 
    *  \line example
    *  After that our little test routine ends.
    *  \line }
    */

 Where the example file include_test.cpp looks as follows: 
   void main()
   {
     Include_Test t;
     t.example();
   }

====================================
Command: include
Parameters: ['{'option'}'] <file-name>
Help text:
This command can be used to include a source file as a block of code. The command takes the name of an include file as an argument. Source files or directories can be specified using the EXAMPLE_PATH tag of doxygen's configuration file.

If <file-name> itself is not unique for the set of example files specified by the EXAMPLE_PATH tag, you can include part of the absolute path to disambiguate it.

Using the \include command is equivalent to inserting the file into the documentation block and surrounding it with \code and \endcode commands.

The main purpose of the \include command is to avoid code duplication in case of example blocks that consist of multiple source and header files.

For a line by line description of a source files use the \dontinclude command in combination with the \line, \skip, \skipline, and \until commands.

Alternatively, the \snippet command can be used to include only a fragment of a source file. For this to work the fragment has to be marked.

Note: Doxygen's special commands do not work inside blocks of code. It is allowed to nest C-style comments inside a code block though.

The option can either be lineno or doc. The option lineno can be used to enable line numbers for the included code if desired. The option doc can be used to treat the file as documentation rather than code.

Note:
	When using the {doc} option, some commands like \cond and \if don't work with this command due to the moment of parsing.
	The included documentation should not have comment signs in it as they will appear in the documentation as well.

====================================
Command: snippet
Parameters: ['{'option'}'] <file-name> ( block_id )
Help text:
Where the \include command can be used to include a complete file as source code, this command can be used to quote only a fragment of a source file. In case this is used as <file-name> the current file is taken as file to take the snippet from.

For example, the putting the following command in the documentation, references a snippet in file example.cpp residing in a subdirectory which should be pointed to by EXAMPLE_PATH.

     \snippet snippets/example.cpp Adding a resource

The text following the file name is the unique identifier for the snippet. This is used to delimit the quoted code in the relevant snippet file as shown in the following example that corresponds to the above \snippet command:

       QImage image(64, 64, QImage::Format_RGB32);
       image.fill(qRgb(255, 160, 128));
    
   //! [Adding a resource]
       document->addResource(QTextDocument::ImageResource,
           QUrl("mydata://image.png"), QVariant(image));
   //! [Adding a resource]
       ...

Note that the lines containing the block markers will not be included, so the output will be:

   document->addResource(QTextDocument::ImageResource,
       QUrl("mydata://image.png"), QVariant(image));

Note also that the [block_id] markers should appear exactly twice in the source file.

The option can either be lineno or doc. The option lineno can be used to enable line numbers for the included code if desired. The option doc can be used to treat the file as documentation rather than code.

Note:
	When using the {doc} option, some commands like \cond and \if don't work with this command due to the moment of parsing.
	The included documentation should not have comment signs in it as they will appear in the documentation as well.

see section \dontinclude for an alternative way to include fragments of a source file that does not require markers.

Command: arg
Parameters: { item-description }
Help text:
This command has one argument that continues until the first blank line or until another \arg is encountered. The command can be used to generate a simple, not nested list of arguments. Each argument should start with a \arg command.

Example: Typing: 
     \arg \c AlignLeft left alignment.
     \arg \c AlignCenter center alignment.
     \arg \c AlignRight right alignment
   
     No other types of alignment are supported.

 will result in the following text:


  • AlignLeft left alignment. 
  • AlignCenter center alignment. 
  • AlignRight right alignment 


 No other types of alignment are supported.

Note: For nested lists, HTML commands should be used.

Equivalent to \li

====================================
Command: b
Parameters: <word>
Help text:
Displays the argument <word> using a bold font. Equivalent to <b>word</b>. To put multiple words in bold use <b>multiple words</b>.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: c
Parameters: <word>
Help text:
Displays the argument <word> using a typewriter font. Use this to refer to a word of code. Equivalent to <tt>word</tt>.

Example: Typing: 
        ... This function returns \c void and not \c int ...

 will result in the following text:

 ... This function returns void and not int ...

Equivalent to \p. To have multiple words in typewriter font use <tt>multiple words</tt>.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: code
Parameters: ['{'<word>'}']
Help text:
Starts a block of code. A code block is treated differently from ordinary text. It is interpreted as source code. The names of classes and members and other documented entities are automatically replaced by links to the documentation.

By default the language that is assumed for syntax highlighting is based on the location where the \code block was found. If this part of a Python file for instance, the syntax highlight will be done according to the Python syntax.

If it is unclear from the context which language is meant (for instance the comment is in a .txt or .markdown file) then you can also explicitly indicate the language, by putting the file extension typically that doxygen associated with the language in curly brackets after the code block. Here is an example:

     \code{.py}
     class Python:
        pass
     \endcode
   
     \code{.cpp}
     class Cpp {};
     \endcode

If the contents of the code block are in a language that doxygen cannot parse, doxygen will just show the output as-is. You can make this explicit using .unparsed, or by giving some other extension that doxygen doesn't support, e.g.

     \code{.unparsed}
     Show this as-is please
     \endcode
   
     \code{.sh}
     echo "This is a shell script"
     \endcode

====================================
Command: copydoc
Parameters: <link-object>
Help text:
Copies a documentation block from the object specified by <link-object> and pastes it at the location of the command. This command can be useful to avoid cases where a documentation block would otherwise have to be duplicated or it can be used to extend the documentation of an inherited member.

The link object can point to a member (of a class, file or group), a class, a namespace, a group, a page, or a file (checked in that order). Note that if the object pointed to is a member (function, variable, typedef, etc), the compound (class, file, or group) containing it should also be documented for the copying to work.

To copy the documentation for a member of a class one can, for instance, put the following in the documentation:

     /*! @copydoc MyClass::myfunction()
      *  More documentation.
      */

if the member is overloaded, you should specify the argument types explicitly (without spaces!), like in the following:

     //! @copydoc MyClass::myfunction(type1,type2)

Qualified names are only needed if the context in which the documentation block is found requires them.

The \copydoc command can be used recursively, but cycles in the \copydoc relation will be broken and flagged as an error.

Note that \copydoc foo() is roughly equivalent to doing:

     \brief \copybrief foo()
     \details \copydetails foo()

See \copybrief and \copydetails for copying only the brief or detailed part of the comment block.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: copybrief
Parameters: <link-object>
Help text:
Works in a similar way as \copydoc but will only copy the brief description, not the detailed documentation.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: copydetails
Parameters: <link-object>
Help text:
Works in a similar way as \copydoc but will only copy the detailed documentation, not the brief description.

====================================
Command: docbookonly
Parameters: 
Help text:
Starts a block of text that only will be verbatim included in the generated DocBook documentation and tagged with <docbookonly> in the generated XML output. The block ends with a \enddocbookonly command.

See also: command \manonly, \latexonly, \rtfonly, \xmlonly, \htmlonly and \docbookinclude.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: dot
Parameters: ["caption"] [<sizeindication>=<size>]
Help text:
Starts a text fragment which should contain a valid description of a dot graph. The text fragment ends with \enddot. Doxygen will pass the text on to dot and include the resulting image (and image map) into the output.

The first argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.

The second argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. For a description of the possibilities see the paragraph Size indication with the \image command.

The nodes of a graph can be made clickable by using the URL attribute. By using the command \ref inside the URL value you can conveniently link to an item inside doxygen. Here is an example:

Note:
	usage of this command requires that HAVE_DOT is set to YES
	doxygen creates a temporary file that is automatically removed unless the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to NO.

   /*! class B */
   class B {};
    
   /*! class C */
   class C {};
    
   /*! \mainpage
    *
    *  Class relations expressed via an inline dot graph:
    *  \dot
    *  digraph example {
    *      node [shape=record, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
    *      b [ label="class B" URL="\ref B"];
    *      c [ label="class C" URL="\ref C"];
    *      b -> c [ arrowhead="open", style="dashed" ];
    *  }
    *  \enddot
    *  Note that the classes in the above graph are clickable
    *  (in the HTML output).

Command: emoji
Parameters: "name"
Help text:
This command will produce an emoji character given its name.

The supported names are the ones also supported by GitHub and listed here https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908

You can use the name with or without colons, i.e. \emoji smile is the same as writing \emoji :smile:. When an emoji is not supported the name with by places in the text with in between colons, i.e. \emoji unsupported will produce :unsupported: in the output. Doxygen will also give a warning message.

See also the emoji support page for details.

====================================
Command: msc
Parameters: ["caption"] [<sizeindication>=<size>]
Help text:
Starts a text fragment which should contain a valid description of a message sequence chart. See http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/ for examples. The text fragment ends with \endmsc.

The first argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.

The second argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. For a description of the possibilities see the paragraph Size indication with the \image command.

Note:
	The text fragment should only include the part of the message sequence chart that is within the msc {...} block (this is different from \mscfile).
	mscgen is now built in into doxygen
	doxygen creates a temporary file that is automatically removed unless the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to NO.

Here is an example of the use of the \msc command.

   /** Sender class. Can be used to send a command to the server.
    *  The receiver will acknowledge the command by calling Ack().
    *  \msc
    *    Sender,Receiver;
    *    Sender->Receiver [label="Command()", URL="\ref Receiver::Command()"];

====================================
Command: startuml
Parameters: ['{'option[,option]'}'] ["caption"] [<sizeindication>=<size>]
Help text:
Starts a text fragment which should contain a valid description of a PlantUML diagram. See https://plantuml.com/ for examples. The text fragment ends with \enduml.

Note:
	You need to install Java and the PlantUML's jar file, if you want to use this command. When using PlantUML in LaTeX you have to download some more jar files, for details see the PlantUML documentation. This also is valid for the <engine>s latex and math. The location of the PlantUML file should be specified using PLANTUML_JAR_PATH. The other jar files should also reside in this directory.
	The use of the <engine> ditaa is not possible in LaTeX as PlantUML only supports the png format and doxygen requires, temporary, eps output.

Not all diagrams can be created with the PlantUML @startuml command but need another PlantUML @start... command. This will look like @start<engine> where currently supported are the following <engine>s: uml, bpm, wire, dot, ditaa, salt, math, latex, gantt, mindmap, wbs, yaml, creole, json, flow, board and git. By default the <engine> is uml. The <engine> can be specified as an option. Also the file to write the resulting image to can be specified by means of an option, see the description of the first (optional) argument for details. Of course only one <engine> can be specified and also the filename can only be specified once.

The first argument is optional and is for compatibility with running PlantUML as a preprocessing step before running doxygen, you can also add the name of the image file after \startuml and inside curly brackets as option, i.e.

     @startuml{myimage.png} "Image Caption" width=5cm
     Alice -> Bob : Hello
     @enduml

When the name of the image is specified, doxygen will generate an image with that name. Without the name doxygen will choose a name automatically.

The second argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.

The third argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. For a description of the possibilities see the paragraph Size indication with the \image command.

Note:
	doxygen does not support the Plantuml commands like @startjson, by design, directly but the support can be accomplished, by the user, by adding to the doxygen settings file: 
     ALIASES += startjson=@startuml{json}
     ALIASES += endjson=@enduml
	doxygen creates a temporary file that is automatically removed unless the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to NO.

Here is an example of the use of the \startuml command.

   /** Sender class. Can be used to send a command to the server.
    *  The receiver will acknowledge the command by calling Ack().
    *  \startuml
    *    Sender->Receiver  : Command()
    *    Sender<--Receiver : Ack()
    *  \enduml
    */
   class Sender
   {
    public:
       /** Acknowledgment from server */
    void Ack(bool ok);
   };
    
   /** Receiver class. Can be used to receive and execute commands.
    *  After execution of a command, the receiver will send an acknowledgment
    *  \startuml
    *    Receiver<-Sender  : Command()
    *    Receiver-->Sender : Ack()
    *  \enduml
    */
   class Receiver
   {
    public:
       /** Executable a command on the server */
    void Command(int commandId);
   };

====================================
Command: dotfile
Parameters: <file> ["caption"] [<sizeindication>=<size>]
Help text:
Inserts an image generated by dot from <file> into the documentation.

The first argument specifies the file name of the image. doxygen will look for files in the paths (or files) that you specified after the DOTFILE_DIRS tag. If the dot file is found it will be used as an input file to the dot tool. The resulting image will be put into the correct output directory. If the dot file name contains spaces you'll have to put quotes ("...") around it.

The second argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.

The third argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. For a description of the possibilities see the paragraph Size indication with the \image command.

Note: usage of this command requires that HAVE_DOT is set to YES

Command: mscfile
Parameters: <file> ["caption"] [<sizeindication>=<size>]
Help text:
Inserts an image generated by mscgen from <file> into the documentation. See http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/ for examples.

The first argument specifies the file name of the image. doxygen will look for files in the paths (or files) that you specified after the MSCFILE_DIRS tag. If the msc file is found it will be used as an input file to the built in mscgen tool. The resulting image will be put into the correct output directory. If the msc file name contains spaces you'll have to put quotes ("...") around it.

The second argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.

The third argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. For a description of the possibilities see the paragraph Size indication with the \image command.

Note: The text fragment should include the part message of the sequence chart as well as the starting msc { and ending } (this is different from \msc).

====================================
Command: diafile
Parameters: <file> ["caption"] [<sizeindication>=<size>]
Help text:
Inserts an image made in dia from <file> into the documentation.

The first argument specifies the file name of the image. doxygen will look for files in the paths (or files) that you specified after the DIAFILE_DIRS tag. If the dia file is found it will be used as an input file dia. The resulting image will be put into the correct output directory. If the dia file name contains spaces you'll have to put quotes ("...") around it.

The second argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.

The third argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. For a description of the possibilities see the paragraph Size indication with the \image command.

Command: htmlonly
Parameters: ["[block]"]
Help text:
Starts a block of text that only will be verbatim included in the generated HTML documentation and tagged with <htmlonly> in the generated XML output. The block ends with a \endhtmlonly command.

This command can be used to include HTML code that is too complex for doxygen (i.e. applets, java-scripts, and HTML tags that require specific attributes).

Normally the contents between \htmlonly and \endhtmlonly is inserted as-is. When you want to insert a HTML fragment that has block scope like a table or list which should appear outside <p>..</p>, this can lead to invalid HTML. You can use \htmlonly[block] to make doxygen end the current paragraph and restart it after \endhtmlonly.

Note: environment variables (like $(HOME) ) are resolved inside a HTML-only block.

See also: command \manonly, \latexonly, \rtfonly, \xmlonly, \docbookonly, and \htmlinclude.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


====================================
Command: image
Parameters: ['{'option[,option]'}'] <format> <file> ["caption"] [<sizeindication>=<size>]
Help text:
Inserts an image into the documentation. This command is format specific, so if you want to insert an image for more than one format you'll have to repeat this command for each format.

The first argument specifies the output format in which the image should be embedded. Currently, the following values are supported: html, latex, docbook, rtf and xml.

The second argument specifies the file name of the image. doxygen will look for files in the paths (or files) that you specified after the IMAGE_PATH tag. If the image is found it will be copied to the correct output directory. If the image name contains spaces you'll have to put quotes ("...") around the name. You can also specify an absolute URL instead of a file name, but then doxygen does not copy the image nor check its existence.

The third argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified on a single line and between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.

The fourth argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. This can be useful for LaTeX or DocBook output (i.e. format=latex or format=docbook).
Size indication The sizeindication can specify the width or height to be used (or a combination). The size specifier in LaTeX (for example 10cm or 4in or a symbolic width like \textwidth).

Currently only the options inline and anchor are supported. In case the option inline is specified the image is placed "in the line", when a caption is present it is shown in HTML as tooltip (ignored for the other formats). For the anchor option the syntax is: anchor:<anchorId>.

Here is example of a comment block:

     /*! Here is a snapshot of my new application:
      *  \image html application.jpg
      *  \image latex application.eps "My application" width=10cm
      */

And this is an example of how the relevant part of the configuration file may look:

     IMAGE_PATH     = my_image_dir


Warning: The image format for HTML is limited to what your browser supports.
For LaTeX, the image format must be supported by the LaTeX \includegraphics command i.e. Encapsulated PostScript (eps), Portable network graphics (png), Joint photographic experts group (jpg / jpeg). 

 Doxygen does not check if the image is in the correct format. So **you** have to make sure this is the case!

====================================
Command: latexonly
Parameters: 
Help text:
Starts a block of text that only will be verbatim included in the generated LaTeX documentation and tagged with <latexonly> in the generated XML output. The block ends with a \endlatexonly command.

This command can be used to include LaTeX code that is too complex for doxygen (i.e. images, formulas, special characters). You can use the \htmlonly and \endhtmlonly pair to provide a proper HTML alternative.

Note: environment variables (like $(HOME) ) are resolved inside a LaTeX-only block.

====================================
Command: manonly
Parameters: 
Help text:
Starts a block of text that only will be verbatim included in the generated MAN documentation and tagged with <manonly> in the generated XML output. The block ends with a \endmanonly command.

This command can be used to include groff code directly into MAN pages. You can use the \htmlonly and \endhtmlonly and \latexonly and \endlatexonly pairs to provide proper HTML and LaTeX alternatives.

See also: commands \htmlonly, \xmlonly, \rtfonly, \latexonly, \docbookonly and \maninclude.

====================================
Command: li
Parameters: { item-description }
Help text:
This command has one argument that continues until the first blank line or until another \li is encountered. The command can be used to generate a simple, not nested list of arguments. Each argument should start with a \li command.

Example: Typing: 
     \li \c AlignLeft left alignment.
     \li \c AlignCenter center alignment.
     \li \c AlignRight right alignment
   
     No other types of alignment are supported.

 will result in the following text:


  • AlignLeft left alignment. 
  • AlignCenter center alignment. 
  • AlignRight right alignment 


 No other types of alignment are supported.

Note: For nested lists, HTML commands should be used.
