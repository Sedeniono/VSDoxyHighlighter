Currently, the following values are supported: html, latex, docbook, rtf and xml.\n\nThe second argument specifies the file name of the image. doxygen will look for files in the paths (or files) that you specified after the IMAGE_PATH tag. If the image is found it will be copied to the correct output directory. If the image name contains spaces you'll have to put quotes (\"...\") around the name. You can also specify an absolute URL instead of a file name, but then doxygen does not copy the image nor check its existence.\n\nThe third argument is optional and can be used to specify the caption that is displayed below the image. This argument has to be specified on a single line and between quotes even if it does not contain any spaces. The quotes are stripped before the caption is displayed.\n\nThe fourth argument is also optional and can be used to specify the width or height of the image. This can be useful for LaTeX or DocBook output (i.e. format=latex or format=docbook).\nSize indication The sizeindication can specify the width or height to be used (or a combination).

In case the option inline is specified the image is placed \"in the line\", when a caption is present it is shown in HTML as tooltip (ignored for the other formats). For the anchor option the syntax is: anchor:<anchorId>.\n\nHere is example of a comment block:\n\n     /*! Here is a snapshot of my new application:\n      *  \\image html application.jpg\n      *  \\image latex application.eps \"My application\" width=10cm\n      */\n\nAnd this is an example of how the relevant part of the configuration file may look:\n\n     IMAGE_PATH     = my_image_dir\n\n\nWarning: The image format for HTML is limited to what your browser supports.\nFor LaTeX, the image format must be supported by the LaTeX \\includegraphics command i.e. Encapsulated PostScript (eps), Portable network graphics (png), Joint photographic experts group (jpg / jpeg). \n\n Doxygen does not check if the image is in the correct format.
